services under its control, including this website, any products, mobile
applications, console or PC applications (collectively "Services"). By using the
Services, you are consenting to this Policy and the processing of your data in
the manner provided in this Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please
do not use the Services.

tl;dr - We collect data to provide you services and to improve our services. We

**_This Privacy Policy will no longer be valid from 21st March 2020._**

## Information we collect

We may collect information about the Services you use and how you use them, such
as the selections you make on our Services. We collect PII, DII, and log
information about your interactions as described below.  
Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used to
identify or contact you online or offline, such as your name, address, email,
phone number, photos or audio data, and payment information. The Services may
collect PII when it is provided to us, such as when you use our Services,
attempt to contact us, submit a resume, volunteer, or job application, or
connect with us on social media or one of our partners. For example, you may see
a “Log in with…” button, which means we request PII from a partner to streamline
the login process. You will likely be presented with a “request for permission”
screen by a third party asking to share your ID, profile picture, and other
listed information with us.  
We may also create or collect device-identifiable information (DII), such as
cookies, unique device and advertising identifiers, usernames, and similar
identifiers that are linkable to a browser or device. From these platforms, we
may also receive other information, such as your IP address, user agent,
timestamps, precise and imprecise geolocation, sensor data, apps, fonts, battery
life information, and screen size.  
Our Services also collect information about your interactions, including
navigation paths, search queries, crashes, timestamps, purchases, clicks and
shares, and referral URLs. We may combine this data with PII and DII. For
efficiency’s sake, information about your interactions may be transmitted to our
servers while you are not using the app. We may also partner with third parties
that collect additional information – please see their privacy policies for more
details and see below for your choices regarding these parties.

## How we use the information we collect

We use the information we collect from our Services to provide, maintain,
protect and improve our Services, to develop new Services and offerings, and to
protect us and our users.  
PII is primarily used for business purposes, such as for sending you occasional
newsletters and updates, hiring, responding to inquiries, logins, and providing
Services. When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication as
well as the other information to help solve any issues you might be facing. We
may use your email address to inform you about our Services, such as letting you
know about changes or improvements. Please keep in mind that comments sections,
forums, and other similar areas of our Services are public. Any information
posted in those areas is viewable and usable by anyone that has access.

## Third Parties

While we strive to work with reputable companies with good privacy practices,
this Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or
individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you on the
Services. We also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings
on third-party sites, including social networks. We use third parties to offer
you better Services, such as obtaining analytics about the users of our site and
to help tailor advertising to your preferences. For further information, please
see some of the relevant privacy policies below for our third parties and
additionally consult industry codes of conduct.

## Accessing and updating your information

We aim to provide you with reasonable opportunity to access, update, and delete
to your PII. In some cases, we may have to keep that information for legitimate
business or legal purposes. When updating your information, we may ask you to
verify your identity before we can act on your request.

## Information security

We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized
alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold and undertake
reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and
availability protection. However, since no software or storage system is 100%
secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information associated with the
Services, or any other service for that matter. You can help protect your
account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of
the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and will always be

sole discretion, is important, we will notify you via a Twitter post on
https://twitter.com/dank_zone and/or email to the email address associated with
your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes
become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
