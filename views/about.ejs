          We first started off as a pretty small Discord server run by a few
          friends. Now we have dedicated trustworthy admins and loyal co-owners
          to make our job just that much easier.<br />

          Dhon was the main person that made the server, he is your lord and
          saviour, praise him 24/7 and give him 20 bucks each to join his
          server.<br />

          Our Discord server was originally created to be a community Discord
          server for
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLbN3R9EzPi8GPoH2S6JBBg"
            >Whiffle TF2</a
          >, but that small community has grown to something much bigger.<br />

          But how did the server grow from less than 10 people to the number we
          have today? In short, we banded together with more people (me
          included). So our server of less than 10 friends managed to grow to a
          huge team with many followers, which is what you see today (example
          below).<br />
          <br />
          Just take a look at our Discord server now, we wouldn't have ever
          gotten this far without our amazing team.
